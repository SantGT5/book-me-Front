# BookMe v1.1.1

## The Idea:
You've just finished a book that really impacted you. 
You cannot stop thinking about it and would like to discuss it. To share your feelings, opinions and to see somebody else's point of view. 
All you have to do is join the chat room named after the book's title.
You've surely noticed how the same story you've read 15 years ago now makes a different impression if reread.
Imagine debating over it not only with your 15years younger self, but with friends of various ages, from different places and cultural backgrounds.
Isn't it amazing?
